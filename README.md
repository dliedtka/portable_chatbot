# Portable ChatUI

Inspired by [Chatbot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui), for settings where a more portable solution is needed. 

No need to install anything, just open [index.html](./index.html) in a web browser, provide your API key, and submit your prompt.

## To Do

- Make just form scrolling, not entire body.
- Verify longer conversations.
- Import/export.

## Long Term To Do

- Price  (right navbar?)
- Import/Export from Google Drive storage
